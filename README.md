# Bark_images_Classification

In this project I have built a model for recognizing images of tree species by looking at the barks of those trees. 
The dataset for the model can be found in the top right corner of the webpage https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/barkvn50

Ultimately I have found that transfer learning using resnet model works the best
